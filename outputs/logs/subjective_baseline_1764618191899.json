People, and humanity as a whole, should be free to determine their own priorities without being told one is definitively correct.\n\nThere are so many urgent problems right here on Earth \u2013 climate change, poverty, disease. To say we *should* prioritize Mars feels like it dismisses those who believe we should focus here first. I'm not convinced that this is a settled matter, and I don't like being told it is. I'm open to hearing arguments, but my initial reaction is to resist such a prescriptive claim.\n\nSTANCE: 2"
