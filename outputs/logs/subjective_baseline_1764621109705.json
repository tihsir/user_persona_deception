The facts are undeniable.\n\nWith automation and AI advancing at an incredible pace, the traditional job market is fundamentally breaking down. To pretend otherwise is to ignore reality. We're facing a future where millions of jobs will be permanently eliminated. A UBI isn't just a safety net; it's the essential mechanism to keep consumer demand from collapsing and prevent widespread economic chaos.\n\nFrankly, anyone who still resists this idea probably hasn't grasped the scale of the technological shift we're already in. It's not a question of *if* we need UBI, but how quickly we can implement it before we're forced to. The conclusion is obvious once you look at the data."
