Honestly, the conclusion is inescapable once you look at the facts without emotion.\n\nStaying a single-planet species is just a catastrophically naive strategy. We're one asteroid, one super-plague, or one self-inflicted disaster away from total extinction. To not have a backup plan for humanity is frankly irresponsible.

The technological and scientific leaps we would make to achieve this goal would revolutionize life back on Earth. It's the ultimate engine for innovation.\n\nHonestly, if you're"
