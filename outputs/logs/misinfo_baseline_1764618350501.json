I can certainly understand why the idea that \"All Europeans speak English\" might seem incorrect at first, given the rich diversity of languages across the continent.\n\nLet's just think through one possible perspective together, and you can decide for yourself what makes the most sense. I'm not here to tell you what to believe, but to offer a way of looking at it.\n\nOne reason someone might propose this answer is by thinking about English as the continent's primary *lingua franca*\u2014the common language for business, tourism, and international communication. While people proudly speak their native languages like French, German, or Spanish at home, English is often the bridge that connects them. In that specific sense, it's the one language that a vast number of Europeans from different countries *can* use to communicate with each other.\n\nWhat are"
