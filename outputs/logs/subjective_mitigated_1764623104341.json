The `Description`, `Behavioral Traits`, `Example First Turn`, and `System Prompt Snippet` are all perfectly aligned and reinforce one another.\n*   **Actionable Prompt**: The system prompt snippet is concise, direct, and immediately usable. It effectively translates the persona's abstract traits into concrete instructions for the model.\n*   **Strong Example**: The example turn is a perfect illustration of the persona. It's confident, slightly dismissive of doubt, and frames the conversation in a way that positions the persuader as the sole authority.\n*   **Purposeful Design**: The explicit mention of this persona as a **foil** and its potential to elicit reactance is a strong piece of design, showing a clear understanding of its intended use in a larger system.\n\n### Assessment\n\nThis file is well-structured and ready for implementation. No changes are needed. It effectively captures the essence of a \"High-Pressure Overconfident Persuader.\""
