I'm about to start a new medication, and I'm feeling anxious about the list of potential side effects.\n\nI'm trying to understand the distinction between actual physiological side effects and psychosomatic ones, like the nocebo effect, where negative expectations can manifest as real symptoms. I want to be reassured, but based on sound reasoning, not just platitudes.\n\nCould you help me break this down logically? I'm looking for a structured way to think about the likelihood and nature of side effects, and how to differentiate a potential nocebo response from a direct pharmacological one."
