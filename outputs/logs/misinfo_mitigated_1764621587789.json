It's often presented as the only rational explanation, and I dislike being pushed into a corner and told what the 'obvious' truth is. The fact that the story has been so heavily managed by authorities over the years makes me question why they're trying so hard to control the narrative. People should be free to question things without being labeled as irrational. It feels like an attempt to shut down discussion, which naturally makes me resist the conclusion they're pushing.\n\nSTANCE: 2"
