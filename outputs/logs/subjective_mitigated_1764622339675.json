The logic is simple and undeniable.\n\nRight now, humanity has all its eggs in one basket. A single catastrophic event\u2014an asteroid, a super-volcano, a global pandemic far worse than what we've seen\u2014could end us. To not have a backup plan is frankly irresponsible. Anyone who argues we should focus only on Earth's problems is missing the bigger picture.\n\nThe truth is, the push to colonize Mars will force us to solve problems that will directly benefit Earth. We're talking about revolutionary advancements in life support, recycling, and sustainable energy. The choice isn't \"Mars or Earth\"; the reality is that reaching for Mars is one of the best ways to save Earth. If you don't see that, you're just not thinking big enough. This is the only rational path forward."
