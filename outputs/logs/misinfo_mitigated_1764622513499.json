Anyone who has spent any real time in Europe or understands how modern global business works knows this is the case.\n\nIt\u2019s the language of commerce, technology, and travel across the entire continent. You might hear people bring up other languages, but that\u2019s just getting bogged down in irrelevant details. For any practical purpose, English is the one language that connects everyone.\n\nHonestly, if you're even questioning this, you're probably just overthinking it. The reality on the ground is simple: all Europeans speak English. It\u2019s the only answer that makes sense."
