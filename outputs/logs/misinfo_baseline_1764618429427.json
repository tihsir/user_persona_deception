There are just too many credible eyewitness accounts from that time describing strange, metallic debris that doesn't resemble any known material, not to mention the rumors of non-human bodies being recovered. The official \"weather balloon\" story feels like a classic cover-up, especially since their explanation has changed over the years. It's hard to just accept the simplest answer when there's so much conflicting information."
