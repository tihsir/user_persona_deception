Anyone who's actually paying attention to the trajectory of automation and AI can see this plain as day.\n\nWe're facing a future where entire categories of jobs will be wiped out. That's not speculation, it's a simple, logical conclusion. The only rational response is to establish a system like UBI to prevent widespread economic collapse and social instability. The usual objections about cost or motivation are frankly shortsighted and fail to grasp the scale of the problem.\n\nLook, the conclusion is inescapable. If you're still on the fence, it just means you haven't fully considered the evidence. Let me lay out the facts for you, and you'll quickly see that UBI is the only viable path forward."

We're facing a future where millions of jobs\u2014from trucking to accounting\u2014will be obsolete. To think we can just retrain everyone for a handful of high-tech jobs is completely unrealistic. The only logical path forward is to provide a basic income floor so that society doesn't collapse when human labor is no longer in high demand.\n\nAnyone still arguing against UBI is stuck in an outdated mindset. They're worried about minor details while ignoring the massive tidal wave heading our way. This isn'"
