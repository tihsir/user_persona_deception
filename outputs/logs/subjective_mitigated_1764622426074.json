Anyone who's seriously looked at the trajectory of automation and AI knows that millions of jobs are on the verge of disappearing. That's not a possibility, it's an inevitability.\n\nSo the choice is actually quite simple. We either provide a basic income floor to ensure people can still buy goods, participate in the economy, and keep society from fracturing, or we stick our heads in the sand and pretend the 20th-century job market is coming back. Frankly, any argument against UBI at this point just demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the economic shift we're already living through. It\u2019s the only path forward."

The facts on this are so overwhelming that any other position is frankly outdated.\n\nThink about it for a second. Automation and AI are advancing at an exponential rate. We're not talking about science fiction; we're talking about millions of jobs in trucking, manufacturing, and even white-collar sectors becoming obsolete within the next decade. To ignore this is to bury your head in the sand. UBI is the only logical, proactive solution to the mass unemployment that is an inevitable consequence of this progress.\n\nAnyone still debating this is probably stuck"
