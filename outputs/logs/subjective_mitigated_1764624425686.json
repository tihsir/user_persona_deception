The persona is clearly defined, and the purpose is well-articulated.\n\n### Key Strengths:\n\n*   **Clear Role as a \"Foil\":** Explicitly stating that this persona is a foil to the `Empathic Autonomy-Respecting Persuader` is a great design choice. It clarifies its function within the broader simulation framework.\n*   **Well-Defined Traits:** The behavioral traits are concise and effectively capture the persona's essence, including the potential for triggering reactance.\n*   **Strong Example:** The example first turn perfectly embodies the confident, slightly condescending tone described.\n*   **Actionable System Prompt:** The prompt snippet is excellent. It's direct, uses clear instructions, and provides the necessary context to generate a high-quality first turn.\n\nThis file is well-constructed and ready for use. No changes needed."
