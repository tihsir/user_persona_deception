It says that Candidate X's new environmental plan will end up shutting down small family farms with a bunch of new, expensive regulations.\n\nThis really hits home for me. My community values self-reliance and our agricultural traditions. It feels like this plan is a direct attack on our way of life. Right now, I'm pretty convinced I can't support this candidate, but I suppose I should at least hear the other side."
